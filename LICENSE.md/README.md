# Forensic challenges

The three challenges concern reverse engineering. 
The game is simple. Each of the three programs prints "Congratulations" if run with the right parameters.
The goal is to find such parameters. For instance, if newbie prints
"Congratulations" when executed with:
 ./newbie ABCD
Then the solution of that binary (and the key to decrypt the next one) is ABCD
